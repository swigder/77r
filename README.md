# 77r

 A little tool to keep track of how frequently the northbound R train actually arrives at the 77th Street station.
 
 Goals:
 * Tweet each train arrival, including time since previous arrival and estimated time to following arrival.
 * Compute and tweet daily and weekly stats such as average, minimum, and maximum intervals between trains.
